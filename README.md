Parsing HTML and Renaming PDF files

## The purpose of this script is to:
1. Parse a large string of HTML by using regular expressions.
2. Create a dictionary to store the current PDF filename as the key and the "to be" PDF filename as the value.
3. Change the names of all of the PDF files.

### Please note that the HTML I'm importing in the Python script is not in this repository due to confidentiality.
